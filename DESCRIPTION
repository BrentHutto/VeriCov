Description: 
    Two recent articles by Francisco Veri suggest new ways of evaluating coverage and consistency 
    in fsQCA. This package implements several of his suggested fit measures as well as using the
    XYplot function from Dusa's QCA package to illustrate the areas of X-Y plots referred to by
    Veri. These functions only do plots and computations for sufficiency analysis.
